# Heart Disease EDA

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the `heart.csv` dataset to understand patterns that contribute to heart disease. The analysis focuses on basic data inspection, feature distributions, and relationships between clinical variables.

## Dataset
The dataset includes common medical attributes used to evaluate heart disease risk, such as age, chest pain type, cholesterol level, resting BP, and more.

Source: `heart.csv`

## Objectives
- Inspect dataset quality (missing values, outliers)
- Understand distribution of key features
- Identify relationships between features
- Highlight correlations with target variable

## Methods
The analysis was done using a Jupyter notebook with Python packages:
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib

### Key Visualizations
- Feature distributions (histograms, boxplots)
- Correlation heatmap
- Pairwise relationships
- Countplots for categorical features

## Findings (high-level)
> Add your real observations here after analysis, not generic statements.

Examples:
- Cholesterol levels vary significantly across age groups.
- Chest pain type shows clear separation between risk groups.
- Strong correlation observed between `oldpeak` and target.
